# github-repo-sync

Simple webhook-based utility for keeping a remote GitHub repo up to date with the origin. And zero dependencies!

Based on the code from [this DigitalOcean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-node-js-and-github-webhooks-to-keep-remote-projects-in-sync), extended for a more modular format.
